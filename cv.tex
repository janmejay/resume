\section{\sc Professional Interests and Direction}
Solving problems that are technically challenging, not well understood and/or make a difference to the developer community or society, interest me a lot.\\
\\
I am deeply interested in the areas of {\it algorithmic problems and analysis}, {\it performance and scalability tuning}, {\it large scale/distributed computing and data analysis}, {\it paradigms of programming and programming languages}, {\it GNU/Linux kernel and userland} and any {\it Open Source work} in general.\\
\\
Alongside these technical interests, I like, and have been instrumental in, ensuring consistent and timely delivery of high quality code and end-user satisfaction for very critical sub-systems in extremely competitive market and highly dynamic, agile environment at workplace.

\section{\sc Community contribution}
{\underline {\bf Open Source contribution}}\\
\vspace{-.2cm}\\
I firmly believe in Free and Open Source philosophy and do my best to contribute back to the (F)OSS community in personal time.

I am co-creator and maintainer of popular test parallelization solution called \href{http://test-load-balancer.github.com}{Test Load Balancer} (released under BSD 2-clause license) used by several projects within ThoughtWorks and outside of it. 
TLB supports several test-runner and build-tool combinations across programming languages and provides one stop, minimal configuration solution to all test-parallelization needs. 
It has also been the driver for some really interesting work we did, for instance, coming up with a novel approach to set-partitioning using genetic algorithm.

In addition to my personal projects, I have also contributed patches amounting to several feature enhancements, additions and functional or performance bug-fixes to multiple open-source projects, some of the more popular being JRuby, Maven Surefire, Objenesis, UrlRewrite Filter etc.

I also develop and maintain other tiny projects on github like .emacs.d repository that several emacs users collaborate on and a little android app meant to teach colors to kids etc.

While working for Tavant, I drove the \href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/infrared}{InfraRED} (a J2EE performance monitoring app) integration effort to plug InfraRED with JBoss, Weblogic, Websphere, Jetty, Resin, Tomcat and OC4J etc.

{\underline {\bf Conferences}}\\
\vspace{-.2cm}\\
Being a strong believer in sharing of knowledge or ideas and hacker ethics, I have talked at several conferences about the projects that I work on and problems we solve including some of the more well known conferences like {\em JavaOne}, {\em RubyConf}, {\em Great Indian Developer Summit} and lesser known {\em Devops days}, {\em BarCamp}, {\em Rootconf} and {\em XConf} etc.\\

\section{\sc Professional Experience}

\vspace{-.1cm}
\href{http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/go-agile-release-management}{\bf Go}: Agile release management suite\hfill {\bf August, 2009 - Present}\\
\vspace{-.2cm}\\
{\em Problem}:\\
Go is the first tool in its space to come up with a comprehensive domain to represent build and deployment as a first hand concept. It lets project teams model their process as is, without having to adapt to the tool, and provides visibility into progress and availability of code and features from check-in to deployment/release.\\
Go aims to make Build, Deployment, Infrastructure Provisioning \& Management a breeze and helps dev-ops collaboration.\\
\\
{\em Revenue}:\\
Within a span of 4 years as a product, Go has become profitable. It has about 100 customers globally.\\
\\
{\em Technology}:\\
Heavily multi-threaded, background processing intensive application with JRuby on Rails front end, Spring IOC based Java backend, Spring MVC for parts of UI and RMI endpoints, Hibernate and IBatis talking to an embedded H2 Database, JQuery and Prototype on UI, embedded servlet container Jetty for hosting and Felix OSGi container for plugins.\\
\\
{\em Role}: \\
Responsibility: Senior Developer (dev-2)\\
In the last two years I have transitioned into pseudo tech-lead role wherein Im responsible for delivering the most critical and challenging of features, keeping performance up to the mark and mentoring other developers on the team technically.\\
\\
{\em Responsibility \& Key Challenges}:
\vspace*{.05in}  
\begin{list2}
\item Designing and implementing key features while continuously refactoring and fixing code to keep it easily maintainable, extensible and performant on a 5 year old codebase, and helping other developers learn the same
\item Ensuring continuous delivery, 2-4 weeks production releases(public GA) of the product
\item Working with the developers/maintainers of open-source projects that are a part of Go tech-stack to write and submit patches to fix bugs or functional/performance enhancements
\item Keeping the small delivery team inspired over long periods of time
\item Ensuring quality in terms of functionality, performance and supporting customers
\item Formalizing game changing ideas that eventually make differentiating features which give Go its leading edge
\item Supporting customers in various time zones with an acceptable SLA
